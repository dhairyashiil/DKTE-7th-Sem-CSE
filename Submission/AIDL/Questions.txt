what is parameter - 
	In deep neural network, weights and bias are searched with the help of loss function 
and optimization algorithm during training phase. These weights and bias are called 
parameters.

Hyperparameter - 
	While, a hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning 
process begins. 
	Some of the hyperparameters are learning rate, hidden units, mini batch size, 
beta, number of layers, learning decay rate, number of units in each layers. These 
hyperparameter need to set with correct values to avoid overfitting and underfitting

For tuning deep neural network with different hyperparameters, following methods 
can be used:
1. Manually setting values
2. Grid Search method
3. Random Search method

Lstm - 
Is LSTM a deep learning model?
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a deep learning architecture based on an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN).

How LSTM is used in deep learning?
' LSTM stands for long short-term memory networks, used in the field of Deep Learning. It is a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems.

Is LSTM RNN or CNN?
LSTM is a type of RNN
